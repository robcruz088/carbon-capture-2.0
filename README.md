# pollution-filter-2.0
A complete overhaul of my previous pollution detection project. Will be built up from the ground up again with new hardware and software.

A lot of the work that I had previously done is currently outdated and maintaining it is not sustainable as is. A revamp of the system will be done
in order to not only update the system, but so that
1) Maintenance is more straight-forward
2) New sensors that are more accurate 
3) More efficient and secure data payloads between the systems
